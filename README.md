# # Who I Am

My name is Ihantsa, and I'm a computer science student with a passion for mobile development.
I chose Flutter/Dart, and I'm still exploring this passion. I'm currently developing my skills.
Please feel free to explore my projects below. 
Your support means a lot to me, and you're very welcome.

We love to code!
